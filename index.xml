      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the C++ programming language
C++ is a programming language that was developed in the 1980s as an extension of the C language. This language differs from C in that it has a larger set of features, including object-oriented programming and templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is C++ for?
C++ is used to create all sorts of software, from games to operating systems. This language is also widely used in intensive data processing and scientific computing.
C++ provides developers with a powerful and flexible tool for creating software. It allows you to write efficient and fast code, making it one of the most popular programming languages in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can be written in C++
C++ allows you to create applications and programs of any complexity: from simple console utilities to complex game engines. Also in this language, you can program microcontrollers and systems in real time. You can write almost anything in C++, from system applications to mobile applications. This language is used to create operating systems, software of various kinds, and game engines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;scientific-programming-languages&#34;&gt;Scientific programming languages&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In computer programming, scientific programming language can refer to two degrees of the same concept.
In a broad sense, a scientific programming language is a programming language that is widely used in computational science and computational mathematics. In this sense, C/C++ and Python can be considered as scientific programming languages.
More broadly, a scientific programming language is a language that is designed and optimized for the use of mathematical formulas and matrices. Such languages are characterized not only by the presence of libraries that perform mathematical or scientific functions, but also by the syntax of the language itself. For example, neither C++ nor Python have built-in matrix types or functions for matrix arithmetic (addition, multiplication, etc.); instead, this function is available through the standard libraries. Scientific programming languages in a stricter sense include ALGOL, APL, Fortran, J, Julia, Maple, MATLAB, and R.
Scientific programming languages should not be confused with scientific language in general, which is loose to the higher standards of precision, correctness, and brevity expected of practitioners of the scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;examples&#34;&gt;Examples&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linear algebra
Scientific programming languages provide facilities for working with linear algebra. Dealing with large vectors and matrices is a key feature of these languages, as linear algebra lays the foundation for mathematical optimization, which in turn enables mainstream applications such as deep learning.
Mathematical optimization
In a scientific programming language, we can calculate the optimum of a function with a syntax close to that of a mathematical language. This example uses Newton&amp;rsquo;s minimization method. Modern scientific programming languages will use automatic differentiation to compute the gradients and hessians of a function given as input; cf. differentiable programming. Here, automatic direct differentiation is chosen for this problem. Old scientific programming languages, such as the venerable Fortran, required the programmer to pass, next to the function to be optimized, a function that calculates the gradient and a function that calculates the Hessian.
The more knowledge about the function to be minimized, the more efficient algorithms can be used. For example, convex optimization provides faster calculations when the function is convex, quadratic programming provides faster calculations when the function is at most quadratic in its variables, and linear programming when the function is as linear as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Report</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/report/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Report&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports are documents containing data or news. These reports are used in a wide variety of fields such as science, research, journalism, or business. The format of reports can be printed, digital, and even audiovisual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, in some cases they are not limited to reporting on a specific issue, but also set goals, elements of persuasion (such as suggestions or advice), or even the conclusion of a specific investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Report Parts
Front page. The author&amp;rsquo;s data is detailed, as is the title of the report.
Index. The contents of the report are listed with the page on which it is located.
Introduction. Parts of the report and its total volume are detailed.
Development. The topic being touched is fixed and developed (this is the main part of the report).
Conclusion. The most important results are considered.
Bibliography. The materials used in the preparation of the report are arranged in alphabetical order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Report examples
Research. They offer the result and conclusions drawn from the investigation. In these reports, the researcher must present information accurately and clearly to avoid any misunderstanding. They always include an introduction detailing the methodology used, the objectives of the study, and the theoretical background.
These reports are intended to be a source of information for other researchers. For example: The influence of anime on youth.
Climatological. Informs about the general weather conditions in a specific place and at a specific time. Air temperature, precipitation, extreme events and UV indices are analyzed. In many cases, the results are presented in the form of tables, graphs or maps. For example: Today&amp;rsquo;s weather.
Reading. Typical of the academic field, these reports are argumentative or explanatory writings based on the experience of reading the book. The student explains the content of the work, aspects to highlight, and opinions about the content. In addition, details of key elements such as characters, time, place, and author information are usually included. The purpose of these reports is not only to ensure that the student has read the book, but also that the student has understood it. For example: the book &amp;ldquo;Metamorphoses&amp;rdquo; by Franz Kafka.
Police. These reports are issued by the police authority and describe in detail the fact or event associated with the possible punishable act. They are the point of inquiry for any type of investigation as they detail the event (when, where and how). They must be very strict, precise, impartial and exhaustive. For example: Reporting extortion.
Doctor. This is a written statement written by a doctor about a patient&amp;rsquo;s current state of health, based on his or her request, or that of a family member or responsible person, following an examination, analysis, or investigation. . Some of the data that cannot be omitted from the medical report are the date and place, the details of the patient and doctor, the reason for the consultation, specifying whether it is an emergency. In addition, the doctor must describe the disease and symptoms that the patient is suffering from, along with the final diagnosis. Nor can the limitations that disease entails be overlooked. For example: Sample medical report.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Markdown</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/markdown/</link>

      <guid>https://example.com/post/markdown/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a simple markup language used to create rich text (such as HTML) with a text editor. It allows you to add basic formatting to text using characters known and available on all keyboards. Font size, color, and other advanced options are not available in Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to use the markup language
A person writes text in any editor and adds special combinations of standard characters to it. This is the markup, it shows where the text should be bold, where the heading should be, and where the list should be. Symbols can be used to mark up headings, text highlights, and even complex structures like tables. Special converters form a finished document based on the markup. It&amp;rsquo;s similar to using HTML, but the markdown is simpler and the text is more readable. Converters are either pre-installed in a text editor, such as a note-taking app, or are downloaded separately.
Who Uses Markdown
• Internet users who communicate in instant messengers and write notes in services that support markup.
• Developers who write documentation for projects using markdown - they need a simple and reliable tool.
• Content managers when filling sites that support markdown. The markup can also be used on web pages.
• Bloggers who write longreads when they write materials for articles. Many writing platforms support markdown, such as Notion.
• Writers and copywriters who want a simple text styling tool - markup readable on any device.
• Enthusiasts who use markup for personal purposes: write notes and to-do lists, keep diaries or create flashcards.
What is Markdown for?
• Quickly format an article to translate to PDF or just look nice with no extra effort.
• Layout of a text document for placement on the site, but without the use of HTML.
• Writing documentation for the code.
• Making notes in a personal digital notebook.
• Writing beautiful messages in instant messengers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Versioning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what is version control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version control system (also used the definition of &amp;ldquo;version control system [1]&amp;rdquo;, from the English. Version Control System, VCS or Revision Control System) - software to facilitate the work with changing information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is version control used for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version control system allows you to store multiple versions of the same document, revert to earlier versions if necessary, determine who made a change and when, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such systems are most widely used in software development to store the source codes of the program being developed. However, they can also be successfully applied in other areas where work is being done with a large number of continuously changing electronic documents. In particular, version control systems are used in CAD, usually as part of product data management (PDM) systems. Versioning is used in the Configuration Management Tools (Software Configuration Management Tools)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is git?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is a set of console utilities that track and commit changes to files. With it, you can compare, analyze, edit, merge changes, and revert back to your last save. This process is called version control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, firstly, to track the changes that have occurred with the project over time. Simply put, we can see how the program files have changed at all stages of development and, if necessary, go back and edit something. Often there are situations when, in a completely working code, you need to make certain changes or improve some functionality, at the request of the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is extremely useful when several specialists are working on the same project at the same time. Without the Git, there would be a collapse when the developers, after copying all the code from the main folder and doing what they intended with it, would try to put all the code back at the same time.
Git is distributed, meaning it doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on a single central server that stores files. Instead, it works entirely locally, storing data in directories on the hard drive called a repository. However, you can keep a copy of the repository online, which makes it much easier for multiple people to work on the same project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://example.com/post/writing-technical-content/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this page, you&amp;rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;examples&#34;&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;code&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the &lt;code&gt;syntax_highlighter&lt;/code&gt; option in your &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv(&amp;quot;data.csv&amp;quot;)
data.head()
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;data.csv&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;mindmaps&#34;&gt;Mindmaps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply insert a Markdown &lt;code&gt;markmap&lt;/code&gt; code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
```markmap {height=&#34;200px&#34;}
- Hugo Modules
  - wowchemy
  - wowchemy-plugins-netlify
  - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms
  - wowchemy-plugins-reveal
```
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;markmap&#34; style=&#34;height: 200px;&#34;&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;- Hugo Modules
  - wowchemy
  - wowchemy-plugins-netlify
  - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms
  - wowchemy-plugins-reveal&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
```markmap

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;charts&#34;&gt;Charts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wowchemy supports the popular &lt;a href=&#34;https://plot.ly/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Plotly&lt;/a&gt; format for interactive charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example &lt;code&gt;line-chart.json&lt;/code&gt;, and then add the &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; chart data=&amp;quot;line-chart&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demo:&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;div id=&#34;chart-127396854&#34; class=&#34;chart&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  (function() {
    let a = setInterval( function() {
      if ( typeof window.Plotly === &#39;undefined&#39; ) {
        return;
      }
      clearInterval( a );

      Plotly.d3.json(&#34;./line-chart.json&#34;, function(chart) {
        Plotly.plot(&#39;chart-127396854&#39;, chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true});
      });
    }, 500 );
  })();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also find the &lt;a href=&#34;http://plotly-json-editor.getforge.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Plotly JSON Editor&lt;/a&gt; useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;math&#34;&gt;Math&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; option in your &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To render &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt; math, wrap your LaTeX math with &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$...${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$$...$${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example &lt;strong&gt;math block&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34; data-lang=&#34;latex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sb&#34;&gt;$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\gamma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;_{n} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\frac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; x_{n} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; x_{n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;^T &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\nabla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; F &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; x_{n}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\nabla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; F &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; x_{n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; |}{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\|\nabla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{x}_{n}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\nabla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{x}_{n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;}

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;IPython.core.display&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./index_1_0.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Welcome to Academic!&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Welcome to Academic!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-python-and-jupyterlab&#34;&gt;Install Python and JupyterLab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Install Anaconda&lt;/a&gt; which includes Python 3 and JupyterLab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, install JupyterLab with &lt;code&gt;pip3 install jupyterlab&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-or-upload-a-jupyter-notebook&#34;&gt;Create or upload a Jupyter notebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following commands in your Terminal, substituting &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SHORT-POST-TITLE&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the file path to your Academic website folder and a short title for your blog post (use hyphens instead of spaces), respectively:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;mkdir -p &amp;lt;MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER&amp;gt;/content/post/&amp;lt;SHORT-POST-TITLE&amp;gt;/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;MY-WEBSITE-FOLDER&amp;gt;/content/post/&amp;lt;SHORT-POST-TITLE&amp;gt;/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;jupyter lab index.ipynb
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;jupyter&lt;/code&gt; command above will launch the JupyterLab editor, allowing us to add Academic metadata and write the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;edit-your-post-metadata&#34;&gt;Edit your post metadata&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first cell of your Jupter notebook will contain your post metadata (&lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/front-matter/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;front matter&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jupter, choose &lt;em&gt;Markdown&lt;/em&gt; as the type of the first cell and wrap your Academic metadata in three dashes, indicating that it is YAML front matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;---
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;title: My post&amp;#39;s title
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;date: 2019-09-01
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;# Put any other Academic metadata here...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;---
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit the metadata of your post, using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; as a guide to the available options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set a &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#featured-image&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;featured image&lt;/a&gt;, place an image named &lt;code&gt;featured&lt;/code&gt; into your post&amp;rsquo;s folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For other tips, such as using math, see the guide on &lt;a href=&#34;https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/writing-markdown-latex/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;writing content with Academic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;convert-notebook-to-markdown&#34;&gt;Convert notebook to Markdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;jupyter nbconvert index.ipynb --to markdown --NbConvertApp.output_files_dir&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-highlighting&#34;&gt;Code Highlighting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inline code: &lt;code&gt;variable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code block:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;porridge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;blueberry&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Eating...&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;math&#34;&gt;Math&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-line math: $x + y = z$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block math:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
f\left( x \right) = ;\frac{{2\left( {x + 4} \right)\left( {x - 4} \right)}}{{\left( {x + 4} \right)\left( {x + 1} \right)}}
$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fragments&#34;&gt;Fragments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make content appear incrementally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;Space&lt;/code&gt; to play!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;fragment &#34; &gt;
  One
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;fragment &#34; &gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Two&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;fragment &#34; &gt;
  Three
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fragment can accept two optional parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;weight&lt;/code&gt;: sets the order in which a fragment appears&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;speaker-notes&#34;&gt;Speaker Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add speaker notes to your presentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;{{% speaker_note %}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Only the speaker can read these notes
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Press &lt;span class=&#34;sb&#34;&gt;`S`&lt;/span&gt; key to view
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  {{% /speaker_note %}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press the &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; key to view the speaker notes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only the speaker can read these notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; key to view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;li&gt;beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simple: White background, black text, blue links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information in information systems (IS) arises in the process of processing stored data. On computers used to build ICs, data is stored in Read Only Memory (ROM) as named sequences called files. Storing files is like storing books in a library, and organizing access to them requires a special system that minimizes access time and provides convenience. The file system is a set of service structures on the media and operating system tools that provide file manipulation. (Historically, the operating systems of the Windows family have developed in two directions (Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Me are one direction, and Windows NT and Windows 2000 are the second direction), providing various means for working with service structures and files). The FAT (File Allocation Table) file system was developed by Bill Gates and Mark McDonald in 1977 and was originally used in the 86-DOS operating system. In order to achieve portability of programs from the CP/M operating system to 86-DOS, it retained the earlier restrictions on filenames. 86-DOS was later acquired by Microsoft and became the basis for MS-DOS 1.0, released in August 1981. This file system was originally designed to provide random access to files on relatively small floppy disks. There are currently four versions of FAT - FAT8, FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32. They differ in the bitness of records in the disk structure, that is, the number of bits allocated for storing the cluster number. FAT12 is mainly used for floppy disks, FAT16 for small disks, FAT32 for hard disks. Based on FAT, a new exFAT (extended FAT) file system was developed, which is used primarily for flash drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;fat-structure&#34;&gt;FAT structure&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the FAT file system, the disk space of any logical drive is divided into two areas:
• system area and
• data area.
The system area is created and initialized when formatting, and subsequently updated when manipulating the file structure. The system area consists of the following components:
• the boot sector containing the boot record (boot record);
• reserved sectors (they may not exist);
• file allocation tables (FAT, File Allocation Table);
• Root directory (ROOT). These components are located on the disk one after another. The data area contains files and directories subordinate to the root. The data area is divided into so-called clusters. A cluster is one or more contiguous sectors of a data area. On the other hand, a cluster is the smallest addressable unit of disk space allocated to a file. Those. a file or directory occupies an integer number of clusters. To create and write a new file to disk, the operating system allocates several free disk clusters for it. These clusters do not have to follow each other. For each file, a list of all cluster numbers that are provided to this file is stored. Splitting a data area into clusters instead of using sectors allows you to:
• reduce the size of the FAT table;
• reduce file fragmentation;
• the length of file chains is reduced and access to the file is accelerated. However, a cluster size that is too large leads to inefficient use of the data area, especially in the case of a large number of small files (after all, an average of half a cluster is lost for each file). In modern file systems (FAT32, HPFS, NTFS) this problem is solved by limiting the cluster size (maximum 4 KB)
The map of the data area is the File Allocation Table (FAT). Each element of the FAT table (12, 16 or 32 bits) corresponds to one disk cluster and characterizes its state: free, busy or is a bad cluster.
• If the cluster is allocated to any file (ie, busy), then the corresponding FAT entry contains the number of the next file cluster;
• the last cluster of the file is marked with a number in the range FF8h - FFFh (FFF8h - FFFFh);
• if the cluster is free, it contains the null value 000h (0000h);
• an unusable (failed) cluster is marked with the number FF7h (FFF7h). Thus, in the FAT table, clusters belonging to the same file are linked in chains. The file allocation table is stored immediately after the boot record of the logical disk, its exact location is described in a special field in the boot sector. It is stored in two identical copies that follow each other. When the first copy of the table is destroyed, the second is used. Due to the fact that FAT is used very heavily when accessing a disk, it is usually loaded into the RAM (into the I / O buffer or cache) and remains there for as long as possible.
You can use the Disk Editor utility to view and edit the FAT table.
Detailed info
The information about the file itself is stored in another structure called the root directory. Each logical drive (The hard drive is a physical device, i.e. it can be physically installed, replaced or removed. For convenience, the hard drive is divided into logical drives that are virtual and cannot be touched, as they say. On one hard drive can be: • either several logical drives, • or a single logical drive.) has its own root directory (ROOT, English - root). The root directory describes files and other directories. The directory element is a file descriptor (descriptor). The descriptor of each file and directory includes it
• Name
• extension
• date of creation or last modification
• time of creation or last modification
• attributes (archive, directory attribute, volume attribute, system, hidden, read-only)
• file length (0 for directory)
• a reserved field that is not used
• number of the first cluster in the chain of clusters assigned to the file or directory; having received this number, the operating system, referring to the FAT table, will also find out all the other numbers of file clusters.
So, the user launches the file for execution. The operating system looks for a file with the desired name by looking at file descriptions in the current directory. When the required element is found in the current directory, the operating system reads the number of the first cluster of this file, and then determines the remaining cluster numbers from the FAT table. Data from these clusters is read into RAM, combined into one continuous section. The operating system transfers control to the file, and the program starts running.
You can also use the Disk Editor utility to view and edit the ROOT directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;varieties-of-fat&#34;&gt;Varieties of FAT&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VFAT file system The VFAT (virtual FAT) file system first appeared in Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and was designed for protected mode file I/O. This file system is used by Windows 95. It is also supported by Windows NT 4. VFAT is the native 32-bit file system of Windows95. It is controlled by the VFAT.VXD driver. VFAT uses 32-bit code for all file operations and can use 32-bit protected mode drivers. BUT, the file allocation table entries remain 12- or 16-bit, so the disk uses the same data structure (FAT). Those. The VFAT table format is the same as the FAT format. VFAT supports long filenames along with &amp;ldquo;8.3&amp;rdquo; names. (VFAT is often said to be FAT with support for long names). The main disadvantage of VFAT is the large losses for clustering with large logical disk sizes and restrictions on the size of the logical disk itself.
FAT32 file system This is a new implementation of the idea of using the FAT table. FAT32 is the latest version of the FAT file system and an improvement on the previous version known as FAT16. It was created to overcome FAT16 volume size limitations while still allowing legacy MS-DOS programming code and preserving the format. FAT32 is a completely independent 32-bit file system. First used in Windows OSR2 (OEM Service Release 2). FAT32 is currently used in Windows 98 and Windows ME. It contains numerous improvements and additions over previous FAT implementations.
1. Much more efficient use of disk space due to the fact that it uses smaller clusters (4 KB) - it is estimated that it saves up to 15%.
2. Has an extended boot record that allows you to create copies of critical data structures, which increases the disk&amp;rsquo;s resistance to violations of disk structures
3. Can use a FAT backup instead of a standard one.
4. Can move the root directory, in other words, the root directory can be located in an arbitrary place, which removes the limit on the size of the root directory (512 elements, since ROOT was supposed to occupy one cluster).
5. The structure of the root directory has been improved. Additional fields have appeared, for example, creation time, creation date, last access date, checksum. There are still multiple descriptors for a long filename. exFAT An updated file system created by Microsoft to replace FAT32. Started in Windows Vista SP1 and has a maximum file size of 16 exabytes (EB), which is 1 EB = 1018 bytes. Compatible with Mac OS and Windows, it is a very good system for sharing large files. Cons: • It does not have any logging functionality, in which all changes to files on disk are logged before they are actually executed. • Not supported by Apple&amp;rsquo;s Time Machine. In a word, you will not be able to backup from Apple using Time Machine software. • Very complex structure requiring more computing power. Pros: • Rewrites the same sector fewer times&lt;/p&gt;
